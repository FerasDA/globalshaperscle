# Our Mission 

The [Global Shapers Community](https://www.globalshapers.org/), an initiative of the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/), is an international network of young leaders. Created to empower youth to self-organize for impact and to amplify the voice of young leaders, the Shapers Community is a network of over 300 city-based hubs full of change-makers looking to positively impact the world.

Here in Cleveland, we believe there are hundreds of energetic citizens looking for a way to positively impact our city.

Our hub's goal is to leverage the passion of this diverse group of young leaders to create local change through a global lens by sparking critical conversations, prototyping design solutions, supporting community partners through project sprints, and approaching problems through the lens of human-centered design.

How do we do that? Our strategy is a three-pronged approach:

**CULTIVATE**

Examine our project intentions, community needs, and potential project impact while developing an internal culture that is conducive to meaningful social impact.

* Service events
* Human-centered design analysis
* Hub meetings & retreats
* World Economic Forum (WEF) events
* Shaper Summits

**AMPLIFY**

Supporting community partners by sourcing our members’ passions & skills to complete shorter, focused projects. These opportunities help members build critical skills while creating immediate impact.
